# Numerica App
Numerica is a cutting-edge company, pushing the boundaries on technology and algorithms to deliver best-in-class solutions for customers. In order to enable this continual improvement, engineers must learn new things to bring in improvements from research, whether that is from the same domain or outside of it.

When I found out that there was the option to provide a code sample for the onsite, I put together this project. I hope it demonstrates my ability to learn a new subject and showcases my programming ability. Thank you for your time in reviewing this project and I look forward to discussing this with you.
